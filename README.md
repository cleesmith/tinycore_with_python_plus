# Tiny Core Linux

### Remastered for Python development and more

***

#### This remaster includes everything needed to code with Python:
* compiletc: for compiling stuff with gcc and friends
* Python 2.7.8, python-distribute, and pip
* Nano
* Vim
* Git
* OpenSSH: ssh, scp, and ssh server
* Cellipede ... ready to run/test

> Note: while this is much larger than
[Tiny Core (15MB)](http://distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/downloads.html "Tiny Core")
and takes a bit longer to download, this takes a lot less time than doing
all of the necessary TCE installs (tce-load) and configuring all of that
to be persistent.

#### Windows usage:
* Dowload ZIP via https://github.com/cleesmith/tinycore_with_python_plus
* unzip download
* double-click tinycore.vbs
